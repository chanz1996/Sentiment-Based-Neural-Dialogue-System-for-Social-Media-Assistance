I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain.

There's a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart.

Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.\n","[Human 1] So, do you do treasure hunting

I'm in a bit of a dilemma. Do I come up with a clever solution or do I stay home and work?\n","[Human 1] I think I'm in the latter phase of puberty. I sometimes drift off during puberty, so I won't count them in your mind. I do know there's a medication available for side effects withv all of this speculation.\n","[Human 2] I heard about tDCS before. It's a high-powered, high-tension, high-pulse, high-disruptive, very high-pulse kind of technology. It's not intended for everyday use, but could potentially be very useful in diagnosing health problems later on.\n","[Human 1] EE I'm Peter Thiel. I'm cofounder oftoshi. I'm a board member ofventurecapital.com and member of theJobs World Just released a report today called \"The 21st Century in Adtech.\" It's a fascinating time to be a Silicon Valley billionaire.\"\n","[Human 2] The world is literally changing! How about you?\n","[Human 1] I think I'm in the 21st century. I inventing ways to survive in the 21st, or whatever you want to call it, is simply terrible.\n","[Human 2] hahahaha, that is a good place to start.\n","[Human 1] The 21st is the most important milestone in human history. Today, we are at the turning point. I believe this country can and should live up to as they have done for many, many years.\n","[Human 2] The past five presidents have been born during that time span. The other Republican has been a world leader.\n","[Human 1] Both of us, what do you think makes this election more important to you?\n","[Human 2] People are giving me these questions. Why are you doing these public records requests?\n","[Human 1] Because I have the power to destroy the GOP.\n","[Human 2] That's a much harder task, doesn't it?\n","[Human 1] Hi\n","[Human 2] Hello, how are you doing today?\n","[Human 1] I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\n","[Human 2] That's great. How's the food?\n","[Human 1] I heard there are meals for lunch and dinner on sale for just under $1,000. I will chime in as soon as they get my order.\n","[Human 2] That's good. I'll pick up something unhealthy and some good food. Do you have any good ramen?\n","[Human 1] Ioners are a favorite, but I haven't tried ramen in a while. Not to brag but ramen is a pain in the arse and I'm not a moron - I know plenty of people who go to pet heaven.\n","[Human 2] That's true. Though I admit, I'm a bit sad that I cannot get by trash can. Me personally, I don't like it when things bad happen to nice people.\n","[Human 1] Are you a food person, a sight to see?\n","[Human 2] Yes! I think of all the food I have eaten that had been turned into food before they are packaged and gone bad.\n","[Human 1] Have you ever had bad ramen?\n","[Human 2] I have never had bad ramen, but my bad experience with it is pretty bad. I have tried ramen hot dogs and pikachu. I will definitely try his.\n","[Human 1] Great! Have you tried any of his other ramen options?\n","[Human 2] He has never had pikachu, but pikachu is still bothering me. Got any good ramen snub?\n","[Human 1] Hee hee hee! here it is :slightly_smiling_face: Phew! I love hot dogs or pikachu.\n","[Human 2] Hot dogs and tennis? Yep, we had a lot of fun last week. We booked a room at a friends place and we snubbed pikachu. I think the pikachu that we snuck into the bar were too lazy to finish up before us.\n","[Human 1] We SWEAT! Did we not say lazy? Did we not say anything about our meal?\n","[Human 2] We SWEAT! Did we not say anything lazy? If we did, we probably would not be able to nap this much. We had a pretty good chance of getting snoozed.\n","[Human 1] We slept well we>>>>>>>> thought but woke up too late\n","[Human 2] We could have snoozed earlier had we known about the lagus
