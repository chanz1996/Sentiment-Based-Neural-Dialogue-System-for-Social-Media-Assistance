# CSCI-544-ANLP-Group-Project

Managing social media connections and an overwhelming online friend list in todayâ€™s world is draining, and it can be hard to keep up with all the text messages and make sure replies are crisp and on time. 
The proposed dialogue system acts as a proxy for the end-user responding to the incoming texts capturing the user's writing style, frequent choice of words, proclivities, and patterns. It also stays a step ahead as it analyses the sentiment of the incoming text and decides if a personalized reply is needed or a generic reply would suffice. This conditions the system to be more discrete and scalable.
